# img-to-pdf-converter-webapp
Simple Webapp designed for online image to pdf conversion.

The "brain" of this program is derived from a previous version, specifically the "pdf-converter" branch, of the pytesseract and opencv software from another project. That source can be found [here](https://github.com/LukeIngram/Raspberry-pi-ML-OCR.git).
