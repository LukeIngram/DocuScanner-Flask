# img-to-pdf-converter-webapp
A Simple Webapp designed for online image to pdf conversion.

The "brain" of this program is a python program derived from a previous version, specifically the "pdf-converter" branch, of the pytesseract and OpenCV software from another project. That source can be found [here](https://github.com/LukeIngram/Raspberry-pi-ML-OCR.git). 



A live demo of this project will **SOON** be available [here](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~lfi23/).
